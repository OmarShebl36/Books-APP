# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is exactly the same as the one created in the Modern React with Redux [2023 Update] course by `Stephen Grider` with some features I added.

## New Features done by me

- Used TypeScript instead of JavaScript in the entire app.
- Created interfaces for the components.
- Added error messages when creating or editing a book by checking the length of its title.
- The error messages get removed after 5 seconds.
